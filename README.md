# Redux (w/RTK)

Create slice, this creates the reducers, actions and state tree

```js
import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
};

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // Redux Toolkit allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers. It
      // doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library,
      // which detects changes to a "draft state" and produces a brand new
      // immutable state based off those changes
      state.value += 1;
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1;
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload;
    },
  },
});

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions;

export default counterSlice.reducer;
```

Configure the store, this is where you would accumlate your state tree reducers

```js
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "../features/counter/counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
});
```

Add provider to application

```js
ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

Exmaple of using selectors and dispatchs from redux to get/set state

```js
import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { decrement, increment } from "./counterSlice";

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button
          aria-label="Increment value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}
        >
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button
          aria-label="Decrement value"
          onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}
        >
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```
